# Simulation and Task Planning App

This project is developed as a task planning and simulation tool for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and defense systems. The application offers features like setting routes on a map, adding target points, and creating UAV simulations. This tool allows UAVs to successfully simulate tasks such as data collection and analysis based on designated targets.

## Features

### 1. Route Setting and Target Point Addition on the Map
- Users can set routes for UAVs on the map by dragging and dropping and add strategic target points.
- Saved routes and target points can be used later in simulations.

### 2. Simulation Speed Adjustment and Route Playback
- Adjust the simulation speed to make the UAV follow the route slower or faster.
- You can play and pause the route to analyze tasks at different speeds.

### 3. Real-Time Status Tracking of Targets and Location Display
- The application provides real-time display of the UAV's current position and the status of designated target points on the map.
- Track target completion status and UAV position updates in real-time.

### 4. Data Collection and Analysis Simulation
- Simulates data collection and analysis tasks based on the UAV's targets along its route.
- When the UAV passes over target points, analysis is conducted, and the collected data is displayed.

### 5. Analytical Data and Statistical Outputs
- After the simulation, receive analytical data of the routes and statistics of the targets as output.
- These data can be used to assess the success of tasks conducted along the route.
